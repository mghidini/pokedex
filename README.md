_Matilde Ghidini - September 2024_

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for BLING Internship Technical Test.

## Project Description
The objective is to create Next.js project and connecting it to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).

The HomePage retrieves data from the PokeAPI, displaying the names of the first 20 Pokémon.
The user can load more pokemon by clicking a specific button at the bottom of the list. The action is repeatable until there are no more pokemons to show.

When the user click on the name of a pokemon in the HomePage he is redirected to the Details page, where all the details of the pokemon are displayed.

## Design Inspiration
Since the logic of the project aims to simulate a _Pokédex_, the design of this project draws inspiration from the _Pokédex_ itself. The choice of fonts, colors, and shapes try to evoke the visual style and feel of the _Pokédex_, providing users with a familiar and engaging experience.
